# Book Review App
The Book Review App is a full-stack MERN application designed to help users discover, review, and share books. It will feature a user-friendly interface for browsing available books, 
adding new titles, and posting reviews to guide fellow readers. By incorporating external data (e.g., book covers from an API), the app aims to provide a richer and more engaging experience 
for book enthusiasts.
